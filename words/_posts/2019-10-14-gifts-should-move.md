[Amazing Grace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypHZbtqSU48) is a movie that makes you think about our gifts and how we use them and what responsibility we have to share those gifts with the world. :heart:

Its like with the Al-Baḥr Al-Mayyit  y'know! The "Dead" Sea.
Being a landlocked sea with no outflow, its water is trapped with up to 33.7% salinity. The waters are devoid of all life forms, including plants or living creatures, thereby earning it the title of the “Dead” Sea. 

[Give, for whatever you recieve.](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/MAT.10.8.NIV) Its the principle of life; for  *The homeo- stasis.*
