"Food isn’t just calories and nutrients. It’s land use, carbon, water, and culture."
</div>

As doctors, we often frame diet in terms of individual risk: weight, blood pressure, cholesterol. The usual script goes: warn against soda, recommend oats, prescribe DASH or Mediterranean diets. It’s all measurable—and we like things we can measure.  

But what if we widened the lens? What if food wasn’t just about health markers, but also about water, forests, and the world we leave behind?  

I’ll admit, I watched *Cowspiracy* on my phone expecting little more than a distraction. Instead, it reframed something I thought I knew. Food isn’t just calories and nutrients. It’s land use, carbon, water, and culture. It’s health—not just for the individual, but for the environment that individual depends on.

<strong>“Livestock and their byproducts account for at least 32,000 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, or 51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.”</strong> – Cowspiracy
</div>

Though the film leans a bit toward over-provocation, the numbers are stark: food production contributes roughly a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Plant-forward diets already have clear clinical benefits: lower cardiovascular risk, better glycemic control, reduced cancer incidence. But their impact doesn’t end at the clinic door. They also reduce methane emissions, conserve water, and protect soil. In other words, they make people healthier **and** the systems they live in more sustainable.  

Of course, this gets complicated in places like where I am. Livestock there isn’t just food—it’s culture, wealth, and survival. These people have managed grazing lands for generations. Suggesting they rely less on livestock isn’t simple. Yet maybe there’s a path forward: blending traditional wisdom with modern tools like diversifying crops, integrating agroforestry, and gently shifting diets where it makes sense.

<strong>Where clinicians fit in:</strong>
<ul>
  <li>Frame diet as part of both personal health and planetary health.</li>
  <li>Encourage plant-based eating where it aligns with local food systems and goals.</li>
  <li>Reflect on our own food choices.</li>
</ul>
