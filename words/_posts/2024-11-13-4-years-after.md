<b>1. Relationships > everything</b>

<b>2. Shiny objects make us duller:</b>

The grass is always greener until you're standing on it. "No" is still the highest ROI word in my vocabulary.

<b>3. The world is very, very big:</b>

Make something work for one person (could also be yourself), then work on distribution.

<b>4. You can't please everyone:

If you could, there would be no point anyway - it's tough when someone doesn't love your work but it's how markets function. 

Plus its like in the boxing, the blows hit harder in the early rounds, just keep getting up.


<b>5. Rest works: ( So do noon naps, and weekly rest or whatever rituals you do)

<b>6. The price of a good lesson:

We trust a few people or ourselves too much even where we shouldn't. Often this lead to some decent small sized losses as a result.

Too bad it seems (to me) that these mistakes don't stop until the price you pay is so significant you'll never forget it.... (like losing a life?)

<b>7. Live for (in) today, not one day. The process far outweighs the outcome in all parameters.

<b>8. Progress isn't linear:

Especially when you have a little bit of leverage. One day of inspired execution can generate 100x the results of 30 days of uninspired grinding.

<b>9. Almost everyone is reasonable: 

Practice a little bit of empathy and you'll realize most people are just tired and busy, but incredibly forgiving of honest mistakes.


<b>10. Everyone you admire is still figuring it out: 

I had the opportunity to get to know people I genuinely thought were a different species a couple of years ago. 

They aren't. Everyone is trying their best, and those ahead of you are just riding a good guess they made. A reminder not to wait for someone to hand you their map.  Draw your own map.



Cheers to a new year! 
And all the afterthoughts it's going to bring ðŸ˜ƒ
