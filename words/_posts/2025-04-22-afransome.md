Serving on the [AFRAN Web & Media team](https://afran.org/afran-web-media/) under Dr. Gawad has been an honor.  
Over 2 years, from shaping our digital voice to spotlighting [AFRAN 2025](https://www.afran2025.com/) in beautiful Tunisia, it has been a meaningful ride.

Next, AFRAN will be in Tanzania, my very own home country.

I will be cheering from the sidelines as I turn to new academic paths.

**P.S.**  Dr. Gawad offers excellent open-source nephrology resources, including a free AKI course. Explore them [here](https://nephrotube.blogspot.com/p/nephrotube-nephrology-books.html).
