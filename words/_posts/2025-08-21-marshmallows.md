You’ve probably heard of the classic ["delay of gratification" experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment) — where kids had to choose between one marshmallow right away or two if they waited a little longer. The kids who managed to wait were later shown to do better in life. But here’s the thing most people miss.

These kids didn’t just sit there and tough it out though. In fact, most kids who stared right at the marshmallow ended up eating it pretty quickly. The ones who held out distracted themselves — some hid under the table, some sang songs, some fiddled with their shoes. Basically, they looked anywhere but at the marshmallow.

Walter Mischel, the psychologist behind the study, later said:

> “The single most important correlate of delay time with youngsters was attention deployment, where the children focused their attention during the delay period: Those who attended to the rewards, thus activating the hot system more, tended to delay for a shorter time than those who focused their attention elsewhere, thus activating the cool system by distracting themselves from the hot spots.”

This subtle insight has broad implications and applies to almost everything in life. Whether it’s saving money, building a habit, or working toward a long-term goal, constantly fixating on the reward makes it harder to stick with it. Instead, focusing on something else — attention redeployment — creates mental distance from the reward, making it easier to wait and stay committed to your goals.
