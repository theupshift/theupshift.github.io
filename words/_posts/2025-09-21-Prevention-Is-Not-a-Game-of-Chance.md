More than a decade ago, a small study in Tanzania, the RESPECT study[^1] tested an intriguing idea: give women small cash payments if they tested negative for curable sexually transmitted infections. With just 100 participants, the intervention showed that money, direct, guaranteed, and immediate, could help women make safer choices in the short term.



<br>
A follow-up trial, RESPECT II[^2], sought to scale up the approach: 2,206 participants, followed over 36 months. But the design made a crucial pivot. Instead of a guaranteed cash reward, women were entered into a lottery with a chance to win 100,000 shillings (~$50 USD), conditional on negative test results for syphilis and trichomonas. The primary outcome was combined HIV/HSV-2 incidence after 36 months. 

The hope was that the thrill of risk and reward would be cheaper and more motivating.
<br>
<p><em>Well, it didn't.</em></p>
> The adjusted risk difference was –0.001 (95% CI –0.05 to 0.05). The lottery had virtually no effect.

After three years, the results were clear: infection rates were no different between the lottery and standard care groups. Although nearly half of the participants were lost to follow-up, due in part to COVID-19, the conclusion was inescapable. This was not merely chance; it was flawed logic.



<br>
**The Allure of the Lottery & Betting Against Structural Vulnerability**

<br>
Lotteries are cheap but uncertain. Offering a lottery ticket for health to someone in poverty is like offering a chance to win a lifeboat to someone drowning instead of throwing them a guaranteed float. It's a bet on their survival, not an investment in it. 

For women whose lives are already defined by poverty, gender inequality, and unstable work, the promise of a one-in-many chance is no substitute for guaranteed support. A guaranteed $10 can mean a week's groceries for her children; a 1% chance at $50 is, more often than not, a reminder of luck that never seems to be on her side. By trying to design a more “efficient” incentive, the study undercut the very principle that made the original RESPECT results plausible: immediate, reliable, tangible benefit.

The lesson is clear. HIV prevention is not about scratch cards. It is about condoms, affordable PrEP, comprehensive health services, and fundamentally, real economic opportunities for women. Lotteries may make headlines, but they do not change **structural vulnerability**.[^3]

If we are serious about prevention, we must invest in what works: the proven, the durable, and the just.
