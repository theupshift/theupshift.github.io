      "Heartbreak is the heart of all revolutionary consciousness. How can it not be? Who can imagine another world unless they have already been broken apart by the world we are in?"

Gargi Bhattacharyya sees our grief for a broken world as the tool we use to weave a new one. The heartbreak we feel in response to a broken world often becomes the very tool for constructing a new, more just and compassionate reality. It's only when we experience the pain of injustice that we are moved to challenge the status quo and imagine something radically different.
