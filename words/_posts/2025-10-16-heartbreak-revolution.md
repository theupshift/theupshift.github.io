Gargi Bhattacharyya sees our grief for a broken world as the tool we use to weave a new one. The heartbreak we feel in response to a broken world often becomes the very tool for constructing a new, more just and compassionate reality. It's only when we experience the pain of injustice that we are moved to challenge the status quo and imagine something radically different.
