<br>why do we keep doing the same mistakes?
<br></em></center>

Three basic flaws. They are the reason why we keep doing the same mistake even if we know better;

## 1. <justify><span style="color:red">Ego</span></justify> is  the enemy.
We are too invested in our opinion of ourselves that we don't see the feedback to our actions. Even when we do, we over defend our wrong actions.

## 2. It is the <justify><span style="color:red">"distance"</span></justify>.
Its easier to fool ourselves that we're right at a macro-level than at the micro-level. 
When we are at a distant place, time or position we don't feel the immediate effects of our actions.

That's why many politicians are terrible doing same shit.
<br>.. Same applies to people who keep eating carb and junks regardless of all health advice ... the painful after-effect isn't that immediate enough to make as change.

## + Our<justify><span style="color:red"> default perspective.</span></justify> limits. 

It's very hard to change the system you are in. It's easier to know change + what needs to be improved when from an external reference point. (Basic Galileo physics[^1]).  Here is why knowledge matter if we are to avoid the same mistakes.

:bulb: got ideas on how to avoid these flaws?

Would love to hear your insights!
