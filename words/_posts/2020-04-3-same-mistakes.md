# why we keep doing the same mistakes.

*been there, done that; same mistake.
why?
Three basic flaws.
They are the reason why we keep doing the same mistake even if we know better.*

your smart but doing same mistake?

## <justify><span style="color:red">Ego</span></justify> is always the enemy.
We are too invested in our opinion of ourselves that we don't see the feedback to our actions. Even when we do, we over defend the self.

## It's the <justify><span style="color:red">distance.</span></justify>
Its easier to fool ourselves that we're right at a macro-level than at the micro-level. 
When we are at a distant place, time or position we don't feel the immediate effects of our actions.

That's why many politicians suck and do same shit 
.. same applies to people who keep eating carb and junks regardless of all health advice ... the painful after-effect isn't that immediate enough to make as change.

It's very hard to change the system you are in. It's easier to know change + what needs to be improved when from an external reference point. (Basic Galileo physics[^1]).  Here is why knowledge matter if we are to avoid the same mistakes.

got ideas on how to avoid these :bulb:?
shot me an email [(upshitmail)](emailto:silasgamba@gmail.com).  would love to hear your insights!
