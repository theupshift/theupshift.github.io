<center>One aphorism i'have been pondering lately:

**... In a perfect world, everyone is blind.**

Perfect. Blindness? Really, Everyone?</center>

❗️It's just Brosh's new book, [Solutions and Other Problems](https://www.amazon.com/Untitled-AB-Be-Confirmed-Gallery/dp/1982156945). After the thrilling Hyperbole and a half, It took 7 years for her to write a new book.

The new book is, Hysterical. Sad. Poignant & Worth the wait!

2. You can workout and eat healthy, but if you don't deal with the stuff going on in your head and heart you will still be unhealthy.
3. This is really "[still the one](https://youtu.be/_QWZQh0YYWA)" of the songs that moves me.[🎵](https://youtu.be/_QWZQh0YYWA)

**P.S.**  How long will you put off what you are capable of doing just to continue what you are comfortable doing?
