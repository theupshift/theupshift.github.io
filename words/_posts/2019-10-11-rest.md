Rest can feel elusive. Esp in the dot somethn' era, where that which should make us feel rested often doesn’t. 

But amidst all the chaos, This is what he says;
>“My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”
>- GOD [Exodus 33,14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Exod%2033)
So cool off!:smiley:
