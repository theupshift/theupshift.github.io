Rest can feel elusive. Esp in the dot somethn' era, where that which should make us feel rested often doesn’t. 

But amidst all the chaos, This is what he says;
>“My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.” - GOD [Exodus 33,14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Exod%2033)

So cool off!  :smiley:
