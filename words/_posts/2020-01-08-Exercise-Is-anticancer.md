So in one of my latest e-surfing i ended up on this one journal page..  an article by *Kurgan et al*[^1] with some medical kind of way fancy title.

**"Inhibition of Human Lung Cancer Cell Proliferation and Survival by Post-Exercise Serum Is Associated with the Inhibition of Akt, mTOR, p70 S6K, and Erk1/2"**

Yep that a long & complex one. But this is what i found interesting in it.

If that's still complex here is a simplified version.

*Exercises kills some cancer cells.*


So i ended up googling up for more on exercise- cancer link. 
It looks like there is concrete evidence that acute exercise as well as exercise training (chronic exercise) induce changes in serum factors that can lead to significant inhibition of cancer cell growth.

Experts recommend 30 minutes of aerobic exercise 3 times a week and strength training 2 to 3 times a week[^2].
Looks like its about time to promote physical activity cancer patients as a part of management. 

Nah forget the patients, This one study, by JAMA Internal Medicine,[^3] found that physical activity was associated with a significantly decreased risk of not only colon, breast, and endometrial cancers, but also esophageal cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, kidney cancer, and myeloid leukemia. 

Thats alot of cancers prevented. Time to sweat for health. :muscle:
