Here’s a question that’s uncomfortable in all the right ways:

**“How might I be complicit in creating the conditions I say I don’t want?”**

Most people avoid it. Which is exactly why it works.

We all have patterns we complain about; stress, messy relationships, stalled projects, the same frustrations replaying in a loop. But patterns don’t survive without our participation.

Sometimes we fuel them by staying quiet.  
Sometimes by procrastinating.  
Sometimes by pretending we don’t have agency when we actually do.

This isn’t about blame. It’s about leverage.

When you see your role clearly, you get to rewrite it. You get to stop feeding the problem and start feeding the change.

Sit with the question for a few minutes. It won’t feel cozy, but it will feel clarifying.

And clarity is the beginning of freedom.
