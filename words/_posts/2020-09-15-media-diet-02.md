A quick reviews of some things Iâ€™ve read, seen, heard, and experienced in the past month and a half.

ðŸ“º  *Watching*

<small>I have been watching Billions S2 (B-) the story line is starting to get predictable. But, Greyhound (B+) was fantastic, i had watched a documentary and seeing the movie was a cherry on top of it. 

<small>Rewatched Pulp Fiction (A-). And i managed to binge watch all eps of The 100 (C) in just 3 days. It was cool, but too many resets and bad camera angles so lots of skips i did.


ðŸŽ§ *Listening*

Story of the African Mob - Navy Kenzo (B) is an amazing work.

Ear candy! thats what SOUTHSIDE -Sam Hunt (B+)album is,& his speak/sing style .

Also I enjoyed Tim's interview with Mariaâ€™s Papova (B+) especially her views on routines;

> So, I'm a little bit reluctant to discuss routine as some holy grail of creative process because it's just really â€“ it's a crutch.

Ã‡a c'est fait by Souf (B+) is on Repeat.

ðŸ“š *Reading*

I Will Teach You To Be Rich by Rami Seth (B) who knows, maybe i willðŸ˜‚.

Allergies (articles from pubmed & Nelson Textbook). Modern kids nowadays are allergic to everything! Thought i should read more about it.

Oh and Mere Christianity by CS.Lewis (A+) reading it for a 3rd time.
