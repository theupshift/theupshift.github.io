A quick reviews of some things Iâ€™ve read, seen, heard, and experienced in the past month and a half.
<!-- more -->

ðŸ“º  *Watching*

[Billions S2](h) (B-) the story starts to get predictable. But, Greyhound (B+) was fantastic, i had watched a documentary and seeing the movie was a cherry on top of it. 

[Pulp Fiction](h) (A-) Rewatching it for its great lines.

Managed to binge watch all eps of 
[The 100](h) (C) in just 3 days. It was cool, but too many resets and bad camera angles so lots of skips i did.


ðŸŽ§ *Listening*

[Story of the African Mob](h) - Navy Kenzo (B) is an amazing work.

Ear candy! thats what [SOUTHSIDE](h) -Sam Hunt (B+)album is,& his speak/sing style .

Also I enjoyed [Tim's interview](h) with Mariaâ€™s Papova (B+) especially her views on routines;

> So, I'm a little bit reluctant to discuss routine as some holy grail of creative process because it's just really â€“ it's a crutch.


ðŸ“š *Reading*

[I Will Teach You To Be Rich](h) by Rami Seth (B) who knows, maybe i willðŸ˜‚.

[Allergies](h) (articles from pubmed & Nelson Textbook). Modern kids nowadays are allergic to everything! Thought i should read more about it.

Oh and [Mere Christianity](h) by CS.Lewis (A+) reading it for a 3rd time.
