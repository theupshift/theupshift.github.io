üì∫ In [Billions S2](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/billions/s02) (B-) the story gets predictable, Chuck being Chuck and Bobby being Bobby.  Also, after binge watching whole of [The 100](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt2661044/reviews) (C) i think its cool, but with too many story resets.

üéû [Greyhound](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eyzxu26-Wqk) (B+) is fantastic. WWII storytelling at its best.  S.Jackson phrasing Ezekiel 25:17 in [Pulp Fiction](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x2WK_eWihdU) (A-) is always thrillng to watch.

üéß [Story of the African Mob](https://www.mzukakibao.com/2020/09/album-navy-kenzo-story-of-the-african-mob-download-album-mp3/) (B) is a great afropop album.  Sam Hunt's [SOUTHSIDE](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlb6uLmxZJ4NZwL3ccA1S7gMPH0AcmUL0) (B+); is a total ear candy.

üìù A summary on [Allergies](https://github.com/theupshift/theupshift.github.io/raw/master/files/allergy.pdf) (articles from pubmed & Nelson Textbook). Kids these days are allergic to almost everything! Such a fascinating topic.
