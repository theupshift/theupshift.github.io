<center><i>So COVID19 is a thing. Even in Tanzania.</i></center>

Corona Virus ain't that new though: 2003, first corona virus pandemic, The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1). Fast foward few years later the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS).

<center> But people never learn right? </center>

At least not from science, we even ignore science just for a taste of exotic food![^1] 
 Science warned about this, but i guess bat soup is too yummy :yum: for Ling Shen or whosoever!<!-- more -->
And oh man, this strain is new, so damn different, hence the name "novel"[^2], comparatively a higher concern. 

…   maybe it's not the most lethal or transmissible of viruses but it is high in both categories, a perfect mix as a lethal soup.

Skip the genomis for [#MUSSD2020](https://twitter.com/muss_debate), epidemiologically, COVID-19 is particularly lethal for certain sub-population groups[^3]. 

Kids and adolescents don’t seem to get sick but they are carriers, increasing transmission.

The most vulnerable people are those that are/have one or more of the following: 
- Our elderly 
- An underlying condition (metabolic disease – heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, anemic?) 
- with immunosuppression i.e HIV/AIDS
- Some occupations; healthcare worker included.

A saddening mystery yet is the fact that research has shown when healthcare workers get it, its a severe version of the virus, despite their age[^4]. 

In Wuhan alone, China – reports suggested that at least 1,000 healthcare workers became infected and about 15% of those became seriously ill. 

By afflicting healthcare workers, the virus takes out caretakers of those who are o sick. 
Thus healthcare provision severely impacted.

Further, Italy's situation has taught us that it is morbidity not the mortality rate of the disease that is grave. (Morbidity is the percent of patients that have a illness requiring hospitalization and care)

... due to this high morbidity, COVID19 is a serious threat as it destabilize health care systems which in many countries are already strecthed to limits by diseases like NCDs, TB and HIV/AIDS.

Thats why its crucial to slow the disease spread; a.k.a "flatten the curve"[^5]. This include social distancing and early case identification so the health system aren't overburdened.

Actually, the single most important piece of advice health experts give to help us stay safe from COVID-19 is this one: 

Wash your hands! -- and studies have shown the vast majority of us are doing it wrong. :point_right: [https://wb.md/2TIoTSO](https://wb.md/2TIoTSO) 

But we dont give a damn, we build sanitizers cartels, hoard toiletpapers and facemask that should be used  by patients while making memes. When will we learn and be better?[^5]

P.S. Now about that Greta's Climate Speech, we keep making memes? or we be different?
