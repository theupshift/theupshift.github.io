In the heart and heat of Kariakoo, Dar es Salaam, a group of young men congregates at their favorite _vijiwe vya vijana_ in a lively salon, where haircuts are punctuated by animated discussions. Amid the hum of clippers and casual chatter, they exchange the latest political posts on their phones, with one asking:

> “Do you think she’ll win again?”

A likely reference to Her Excellency Samia Hassan's prospects if she contests in the upcoming election.

In this vibrant corner of Tanzania, young people are no longer passive observers of politics. They’re actively shaping political discourse, engaging through platforms like TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram. This simple moment is part of a continent-wide shift, where social media is transforming how Africa’s youth engage with politics, breaking down the traditional barriers to participation.

## Social Media: From Entertainment to Empowerment

Across the African continent, social media has evolved from a space for entertainment into a powerful tool for political mobilization. Historically, barriers such as limited access to information and time constraints kept youth distant from political processes. Social media, however, has dismantled these obstacles, allowing young people to engage in political discourse like never before.

Take, for example, Nigeria’s 2023 elections, where youth participation reached unprecedented heights. Inspired by the digital activism of the 2020 #EndSARS protests against police brutality, Nigeria saw **39.65%** of registered voters—over 37 million people—aged between 18 and 35[^1]. Social media played a critical role in this surge, with campaigns tackling issues such as unemployment and education. These campaigns helped propel a third-party candidate to prominence, a rare achievement in Nigeria’s political landscape.

## X, TikTok, and Instagram as Political Tools

Platforms like X have become breeding grounds for political expression, with viral videos calling young people to vote. In Tanzania, opposition leader Tundu Lissu, even in exile, leveraged X to rally youth support and bridge the political divide. Online discussions, Twitter Spaces, and local meetups allowed young people to connect with candidates and engage in key issues, facilitating more meaningful political participation.

Beyond simply mobilizing voters, social media has fostered a new generation of youth-driven leaders who challenge entrenched power structures:

- In Uganda, pop star-turned-politician **Bobi Wine** became a symbol of hope and resistance, using Facebook and X to rally millions under the **#PeoplePower** movement during the 2021 elections[^2].
- In South Africa, **Julius Malema** of the **Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)** harnessed the power of X to energize youth and promote bold, radical ideas. His digital outreach contributed significantly to the EFF’s increased youth vote share in the 2019 elections.

## The Power of the Hashtag

Social media also empowers grassroots movements, amplifying voices that might otherwise be silenced. The #EndSARS protests in Nigeria are a prime example. Through live videos and viral tweets, young activists rallied millions to demand police reform. Activist **Rinu Oduala’s** posts reached over **30 million people**[^3].

In Tanzania, the opposition party **ACT Wazalendo** utilized social media to expose election-related violence during the 2020 polls, despite government attempts to block information. This highlights the dual-edged nature of digital activism—while social media can empower citizens, it also becomes a battleground for control, with governments resorting to tactics like internet shutdowns and disinformation campaigns[^4].

## Platform Strengths and the Digital Divide

Each platform brings unique strengths:

- **TikTok and Instagram** excel in **visual storytelling**, using viral videos to connect young people with political issues, as seen during Kenya’s 2024 **#RejectFinanceBill2024** protests.
- **X (formerly Twitter)** is ideal for **real-time news sharing** and debate, making it essential for political discourse.

However, significant challenges remain. The **digital divide** between urban and rural communities limits political engagement for many Africans. According to a 2020 **International Telecommunication Union (ITU)** report:

> - **57%** of urban Africans have internet access  
> - Only **23%** of rural populations are connected

Bridging this gap is essential. Expanding internet infrastructure and promoting digital literacy are crucial steps toward empowering all African youth—not just those in urban centers.

## Online Freedoms Under Threat

Governments’ responses to digital activism raise concerns. In many countries, internet shutdowns, restrictive laws, and disinformation campaigns threaten the free flow of information. In Tanzania, ACT Wazalendo’s efforts during the 2020 elections were hampered by government censorship and Twitter blocks—illustrating the **fragile nature of online freedoms**.

## A Call to Action

Despite these challenges, social media’s potential to reshape youth political engagement in Africa is undeniable. From increasing voter turnout to amplifying youth voices and challenging entrenched political systems, the power of digital platforms continues to grow.

To unlock this potential fully:

- Address the digital divide
- Ensure equitable internet access
- Promote digital literacy
- Protect online freedoms

Social media must evolve beyond a fleeting trend—it should become a sustained force for political change.

> By empowering Africa’s youth, social media can foster a new era of political participation, leadership, and equity.

**The time to act is now**—to amplify the voices of young Africans and pave the way for a politically engaged, empowered, and equitable continent.
