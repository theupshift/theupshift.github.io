<p align="center"> <h2>Medicine: The science & Art</h2></p>

Technical skill, scientific knowledge, and human understanding.... Defines medicine. It’s about how we “know, feels and do”. With time, medicine has changed and it still does, partly due to growth of scientific knowledge and its exchange, yet medicine remains both a science and an art.


*Deductive reasoning and applied technology* form the foundation and the constant reality in medicine is deciphering the complex mechanisms by new approaches to treatment and prevention… the science part of medicine. 

In challenging clinical problems there is a need to identify the crucial elements in a complex. Incidental finding and zebras should be avoided. It’s here where combination of medical knowledge, intuition, experience, and judgment defines the art.
