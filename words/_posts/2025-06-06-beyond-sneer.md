excerpt: "*The poorest way to face life is with a sneer.*"  
As [**Hemingway**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10799.A_Farewell_to_Arms) said, 'Courage is grace under pressure.' A sneer is the opposite of grace. It’s fear masked as disdain. Thriving comes from embracing challenges. Like a tree, rooted in the earth, reaching, bending with the wind, and shedding leaves to make room for new ones.
