<p style="text-align: center;"><i>"The poorest way to face life is with a sneer."</i></p>

[**Hemingway**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10799.A_Farewell_to_Arms) once said, "Courage is grace under pressure." 
A sneer is the opposite of grace; it is fear disguised as disdain, a defense mechanism that masks vulnerability with contempt. 

Thriving comes from embracing differences. Like a tree, rooted firmly in the earth, reaching upward, bending gracefully with the wind, and shedding old leaves to make room for new growth.
