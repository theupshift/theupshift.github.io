You now can review produce like onions on Amazon. But what does the review of an onion really mean? 

Are they reviewing their onion? Onions in general? Their regional onion supply chain? Their onionâ€™s method of delivery? What connection does my future onion have with their past onion? And this is not from The Onion, FWIW.
