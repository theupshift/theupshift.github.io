Sometimes,(actually too often) the references from the pdfs we add to mendeley are broken, i learnt this the hard way after having to repeat referencing around 30+ articles.

In the end i found a way. Some neat, tricky site called ZoteroBib, . 

**How much does it cost?**
Nothing! ZoteroBib is completely free and ad-free. Plus it supports supports over 9,000 CSL styles.
