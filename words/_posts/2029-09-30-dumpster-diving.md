One of the jobs of the artist—finding the treasure in other people’s trash, sifting through the debris of our culture, paying attention to the stuff that everyone else is ignoring, and taking inspiration from the stuff that people have tossed aside for whatever reasons. 

More than 400 years ago, Michel de Montaigne, in his essay “On Experience,” wrote;
