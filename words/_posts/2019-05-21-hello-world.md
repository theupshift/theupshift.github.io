Hi, [I'm Silas](/) and this is a collective of good & randoms stuffs i encounter.  Today marks the first day of its existence—I hope there are many more to come.

My last blog crashed, so i thought i shoud try again:. Writing is something I try to do more and more and I’m currently experimenting with much shorter texts to lower the ambition but increase the Time To Publish... <!--I guess I'm also hoping to find some clarity through writing.-->

And on the subject of writing, [Tim Smith has three rules](https://brightpixels.blog/hello) he follows. I like them so I'm going to use them too:

> 1. I’ll write when I feel like it.
  2. I dont keep track of stats.
  3. I will write because it’s fun.

Other than to write, there is a second reason this site exists: it is sort of a creative outlet for me. I love to tweak its design, tech, you-name-it. If you are curious about how it is designed and/or made, check out the [colophon](/colophon).
