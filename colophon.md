# Colophon

This site is set in [Valkyrie](https://mbtype.com/fonts/valkyrie/), built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). You can check out the source [here](https://github.com/upmusings/upshift).

Valkyrie is a humanist typeface made by [Matthew Butterick](https://mbtype.com/bio.html) that has a beautiful calligraphic feel. In order to really appreciate it and improve this site's typography, I've enabled ligatures and kerning. There are other typographic features being controlled via CSS as well, so I encourage you to view the source and poke around.

As for content management, I've used many static site generators in the past (including [one made by hager](https://github.com/hagerstown/comprehensive-plan)), but decided to use Jekyll because [it works seamlessly with GitHub Pages](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/). Changes are tracked by Git and every time I push, my site is automatically builtâ€”saving me the headache of having to deploy the built files to a separate repo or branch.

It may also interest some that this blog supports title-less posts by design, making it easy and efficient to get thoughts out without stewing over an appropriate title. This also works really well for integrating with Micro.blog. To accomplish this I've set an empty default title for posts and used a healthy amount of conditionals in my templates.
